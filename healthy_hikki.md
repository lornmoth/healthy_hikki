## GUIDE
Eat whatever you want whenever you're hungry, but only until the point you're not hungry anymore, not to the point of being full. Eat kimchi and rice or yogurt as a side-dish to each meal, and snack freely inbetween.

NOTE: If you want to do no-carb, simply cut out the rice - I recommend pairing with a solid intermittent fasting schedule (8HR eating window, 16HR no-eating).

Go-to grocery every 2 weeks (how long eggs, yogurt and fruit will generally last) and buy enough for every 2 weeks; except for Sauerkraut and Kimchi which are fermented so will only get better with time. 

Put half your meat in the freezer, and eat the other half during the week. After one week, move the rest from the freezer to the fridge so it'll be defrosted and ready.

## RECIPES

### TAMAGO GOHAN
Take warm rice directly out of rice cooker and place in bowl.
Make a little nest inside the rice and crack one or two eggs directly inside.
Cover with rice.
Add salt, black pepper and red pepper; or add soy sauce.
Mix and eat.

### CHICKEN THIGH, PORK CHOP, RIB-EYE STEAK
Heat cast-iron pot and season with oil.
Throw on, spice and flip until cooked.
(Can be paired with sauerkraut salad)

## SIDES

### SAUERKRAUT SALAD

Throw in pot along with handfuls of sauerkraut.
Season with black pepper, garlic and red pepper.
Stir until ready.

### TOMATO RICE

### BOILED EGGS
Place one dozen eggs in rice cooker with water to cover. 
Set to normal rice cooking time.
To make them extra chewy, re-add water to cover and have it cook a second time.
Add a dash of salt and rice vinegar to make them easy to peel.
Eat with salt and black pepper.

## DRINKS

Pour espresso grind coffee directly into cup. 
Stir and drink.
(If this is too strong/dirty, then get a french press or espresso pot for ~$20. Get a grinder and ground the coffee beans yourself for better taste.)
